How to contribute to rock
-------------------------

  * Fork the project on github
  * Send patches / pull request

We used to be a lot more open about contributions, but things went awry.
Maybe we'll go back to a more open model later. who knows.

Working with forks
------------------

GitHub has good documentation on that, everything you need is here:

  * http://help.github.com/forking/

If you still have questions, ask on IRC (#ooc-lang channel on Freenode)

What happens with pull requests?
--------------------------------

Pull requests are examined as soon as possible by reviewers. If they need
adjustments to meet our quality standards or we feel they could be
significantly improved, we'll let you know by commenting on the pull request.

When the commits are ready to be merged, a reviewer will do so as soon as
possible.

So far, here's our team of reviewers:

  * http://github.com/fredreichbier
  * http://github.com/nddrylliog
